### Hi, I'm Alex.

I'm a recent graduate from Oxford University with an MEng in Materials Science. I am also in the process of completing an MSc in Data Science from Queen Mary University of London (finish end Jan 2022).

I am interested in all things machine learning, and as part of my degree, I have worked on projects such as audio/voice recognition, deep learning image manipulation and recognition, and early asthma detection/prediction.
